# Employee Appraisal and Hike Eligibility Checker

This Python program determines whether an employee is eligible for an appraisal and hike based on their total work experience in the organization and 
their experience before joining the organization.

The program prompts the employee to enter their overall work experience in the organization (in months). 

If the experience is greater than or equal to 12 months, the program prints "Eligible for appraisal and hike". 

Otherwise, the program asks for the employee's work experience before joining the organization. 

If the previous experience is greater than or equal to 12 months, the program prints "Appraisal and Default Hike". 

Otherwise, it prints "Appraisal, No Hike".

## Usage


1. Run the program:

2. Enter the employee's overall work experience in the organization (in months) when prompted.

3. The program will evaluate the eligibility based on the provided input and display the corresponding message, such as "Eligible for appraisal and hike", "Appraisal and Default Hike", or "Appraisal, No Hike".

4. The program will terminate after displaying the result.
